🌍 Life Expectancy Dashboard
📖 Overview

The Life Expectancy Dashboard is an interactive Power BI visualization project designed to analyze global life expectancy trends and the factors that influence them.
It provides insights into how economic, healthcare, and social indicators impact life expectancy across different countries, continents, and years.

🎯 Objectives

Visualize global life expectancy trends over time.

Understand the relationship between GDP, health expenditure, education, and life expectancy.

Identify top and bottom performing countries in terms of average lifespan.

Analyze regional disparities and highlight potential policy implications.

📊 Dashboard Features
🔹 1. Interactive Visuals

Map Visual: Shows average life expectancy across countries.

Line Chart: Displays life expectancy trends over the years.

Bar Chart: Highlights top and bottom countries by life expectancy.

KPI Cards: Summarize key statistics — GDP, population, health expenditure, and average lifespan.

Slicers/Filters: Allow users to explore data by Continent, Country, and Year.

🔹 2. Dynamic Interactions

Clicking on a continent updates all visuals to focus on that region.

Selecting a specific country filters every chart and KPI for detailed analysis.

Choosing a year dynamically changes all visuals to reflect that period.

Visuals are cross-filtered — making analysis intuitive and interactive.

💡 Insights Observed

🌍 Global Improvement: Life expectancy has significantly increased over the decades due to better healthcare, education, and living standards.

💰 Economic Correlation: Countries with higher GDP per capita and health expenditure show higher life expectancy.

⚖️ Regional Gaps: Developed nations (Europe, North America) consistently outperform developing nations (Africa, parts of Asia).

🚻 Gender Difference: Females generally have a higher life expectancy than males worldwide.

🦠 Crisis Impact: Global events like pandemics temporarily reduce life expectancy in certain regions.

🧠 Data Sources

Typical datasets used for this project may include:

WHO (World Health Organization) — Life Expectancy and Mortality Data.

World Bank / Gapminder — GDP, Population, and Health Expenditure Data.

UN Data — Education and Development Indicators.

🛠️ Tools Used

Power BI Desktop — For building the dashboard and interactive visuals.

Excel / CSV Files — For data preprocessing and cleaning.

DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) — For creating measures and KPIs.
